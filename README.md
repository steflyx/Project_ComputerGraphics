# 3D Tangram - A WebGL application

This project was developed for the Computer Graphics class at Polimi by Stefano Agresti and Emma Bortone.

It is a 3D version of the classic Tangram game and implements the WebGL technology. 

The game is able to show the user a shape, which the user has to replicate using the classic 7 Tangram pieces. The user can check whether his solution is correct and can give up, asking the game to complete the shape for him.
